# Nodejs Foundations

## Headers
We use headers to store metadatas(INFO)

## Stream
Read/Write something bit a bit

## stdin
It is a Readable Stream

## stdou
It is a Writable Stram

## Buffer
It is a fixed-length sequence of bytes. Basically, it is a representation of a space taken in computer memory, used to send and receive data in a fast way. It's faster to store and read data in binary than in text for example, and read it chunck by chunck.

## Middlewares
It is an interceptor.
